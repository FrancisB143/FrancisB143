My name is Francis Franklin Bangoy, I'm 19 years old and a proud student of the University of the Immaculate Conception. I live in Davao City, Philippines. I have a strong passion for programming and truly enjoy spending time honing my skills in this field. Outside of coding, I love playing basketball, as well as mobile and PC games. Also watching anime is one of my favorite ways to relax and get inspired.
